# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles and classes not being applied because the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` is missing file paths.  The initial `tailwind.config.js` lacks the necessary file paths. The updated `tailwind.config.fixed.js` file addresses this error by correctly specifying where Tailwind should look for class names in your project.

## Problem

If Tailwind CSS isn't picking up your custom styles or classes, it's likely that the `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` isn't correctly configured to include all your HTML and JavaScript files.  This can lead to build errors and missing styles.

## Solution

Ensure the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` includes all the directories containing files that use Tailwind CSS classes.  Incorrectly configuring this array will cause Tailwind to fail to detect and apply your custom styles.

This example demonstrates how to include files from multiple directories, ensuring all Tailwind CSS classes and styles are properly registered and compiled.
